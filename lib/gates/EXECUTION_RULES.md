## Git signing during automated work

For every project, building, testing, verification, approval, and completion
must work without creating a project commit. Do not require a baseline,
checkpoint, implementation, or final commit, or a clean working tree, as a
prerequisite for those stages. This also applies when resuming an older plan:
replace commit-dependent verification with equivalent file-based evidence;
do not ask the user to commit to unblock ordinary build work.

Use file hashes and path inventories that include
untracked files instead of requiring a clean Git status. Snapshot protected
inputs before changes and protected test paths immediately before checks;
compare afterward without refreshing the snapshot. Leave real project commits
to the final user-approved publishing flow unless the user explicitly requests
an intermediate commit. Publishing and PR creation are optional follow-up
actions; declining them does not invalidate completed build work. A generated
plan is not user authorization to commit. Tests of Git behavior may create
commits only in disposable fixtures under the signing rules below.

All automated tests and test fixtures MUST disable GPG/SSH commit and tag signing.
Never let a test use the user's signer, GPG agent, pinentry, or private keys.

- Run fixture Git commands with `git -c commit.gpgsign=false -c tag.gpgsign=false`.
- Every fixture `git commit` and `git commit-tree` must also include
  `--no-gpg-sign`; fixture tag creation must use `--no-sign`.
- Set repository-local `commit.gpgsign=false` and `tag.gpgsign=false` in each
  disposable test repository. Keep the explicit command flags as well.
- Ensure test subprocesses use those same settings; do not inherit the user's
  signing configuration. Never run tests against the user's real signing keys.
- Signing-specific tests must mock signing or use isolated disposable test keys.
- Never change the user's global Git configuration or disable signing in the
  actual project checkout to make an automated command succeed.

Real project commits are different from test-fixture commits. A plan that calls
for a baseline, checkpoint, implementation, or release commit does not authorize
the agent to invoke signing. If a real commit needs signing, present the exact
Git command for the user to run, then verify the resulting commit. Do not invoke
the signer, retry a signing failure, or launch pinentry automatically. Do not
replace a required signed project commit with an unsigned commit.

## Launching the finished application

For implementation stages, record the verified launch method in
`.uncle/launch.json` before completion. This is product launch metadata, not a
commit prerequisite. Use one of these JSON shapes:

- Command: `{"kind":"command","command":["python3","app.py"]}`
- Static webpage: `{"kind":"webpage","path":"index.html"}`
- Web server: `{"kind":"webpage","command":["npm","run","start"],"url":"http://127.0.0.1:3000"}`
- No runnable application (for example a library): `{"kind":"none"}`

Use the actual verified entry point and arguments; do not copy these examples
unless they match the project. Commands are argument arrays, not shell strings.
Choose a normal demo invocation, never installation, deployment, publishing,
committing, or a destructive operation. Refresh stale launch metadata when the
entry point changes. The TUI launches it after successful workflow completion,
streams command output in the build window, and opens webpages in the browser
before offering the optional GitHub star dialog.
