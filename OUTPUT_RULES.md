# Output Rules

These rules apply to every markdown document a stage writes for a human to
read: the requirements interpretation, the baseline, the specs, the plans, the
notes, the test reports, the checklists, the verification reports, the audits.

They are appended to the prompt of every document-producing stage, so they
bind whatever agent runs it. They are about the shape of the document, not its
content: a stage's own prompt says what to write, and `lib/gates/GATES.md`
adds the quality gates a plan must pass.

If a rule fails, fix the document before writing it. Do not emit a document
that breaks one and note the breakage in the text.

## Rule 0 — Output target

- Write exactly the file the stage asked for, at exactly that path. Do not
  rename it, do not add a suffix, do not write a second copy elsewhere.
- When the stage explicitly requires multiple artifacts, write each named
  artifact and print its path on its own line. This exception also permits
  source and test edits explicitly required by implementation or repair stages.
- Print nothing to the conversation except the output artifact paths, one per
  line.
- No preamble, no closing summary, no "here is your document", no offer to
  continue.

## Rule 1 — Audience

Write for a senior engineer who already knows the domain and is about to
approve or reject this document at a gate.

- Do not explain what a tool is, why testing matters, or what the project is
  for beyond the single sentence that states the goal.
- Do not restate the prompt, the requirements, or a previous stage's document.
  Reference it by name and move on.

## Rule 2 — One claim per line, every claim checkable

- A statement about the code names the file, and the symbol or line when the
  claim is about one place: `scripts/stagegate.sh:402`.
- A statement about behavior names how it was observed: a command that was
  run, output that was read, a file that was inspected.
- A statement about what will happen is marked as a plan, not as a fact.

## Rule 3 — Say what is not known

Anything unverified is labeled, in place, with what would settle it:

```
ASSUMPTION: the resume PDF describes one role per page.
  Unverified: pdftoppm is not installed, so the file was not read.
  Settled by: installing poppler and re-running this stage.
```

An assumption presented as a finding is the failure this whole workflow exists
to prevent. A document with no assumptions section is claiming there were
none.

## Rule 4 — Structure is fixed, not invented

- Use the sections the stage's prompt names, in that order, with those exact
  headings. Add nothing, drop nothing, reorder nothing.
- When the prompt names no sections, use `## Summary`, `## Findings`,
  `## Assumptions`, `## Open questions` — in that order.
- Tables for anything enumerable: behaviors, invariants, findings,
  dispositions, checks. One row per item, one item per row.
- Preserve any driver-parsed section, columns, status vocabulary, and required
  rows exactly as specified by the stage. Never omit mandatory acceptance rows
  to meet a length limit; shorten surrounding prose first. If required rows
  alone exceed a section or document cap, retain them and report that exception
  in Open questions.
- Give every enumerated item a stable identifier (`B-3`, `I-2`, `AR-004`,
  `MC-7`) so later stages and humans can cite it.

## Rule 5 — Length

- No document over 400 lines. A stage that needs more is doing more than one
  stage's work; say so in `## Open questions` and write the smaller document.
- No section over 40 lines.
- No sentence that survives having its adjectives removed unchanged in
  meaning. Cut it instead.

## Rule 6 — Banned

These add length without adding information, and their presence is a defect:

- "comprehensive", "robust", "seamless", "leverage", "utilize", "in order to",
  "it is important to note", "as mentioned above", "best practices",
  "production-ready", "enterprise-grade", "cutting-edge".
- Emoji, decorative rules, ASCII art, and horizontal separators between every
  section.
- Praise of the plan, the code, the requirements, or the reader.
- Any sentence whose subject is "we" and whose verb is a promise.

## Rule 7 — Diffs and code

- Quote code only when the document's claim depends on the exact text. Quote
  the smallest span that carries the claim, and cite its location.
- Never paste a whole file. Never paste a diff the driver already records.
